                  Being part of the Girls in Technology Society has given me
                  valuable experience of working within a team of students with
                  different computing knowledge and expertise. We meet up once a
                  week for two hours where we learn a range of programming
                  language i.e. Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. Furthermore, we
                  designed a Website for our society.
